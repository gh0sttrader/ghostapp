## Style Guidelines:

- Background: True black (#000000) for a clean, minimalist aesthetic.
- Primary: A desaturated dark grayish-blue (#262A2E) provides subtle contrast.
- Accent: Use bright green (#00FF00) for positive changes and bright red (#FF0000) for negative changes to ensure clarity.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable interface.
- All cards and containers should use rounded corners with a 16px radius for a softer appearance.
- Ensure a responsive layout that is optimized for touch interactions, avoiding small buttons and prioritizing touch-friendly design.
